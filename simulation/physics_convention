Physics is calculated in the same frame of reference as the graphical representation, which also means that:
- The positive y direction is pointing under ground.
- The amount of pixels in visualization may affect the physical space the agents interact with.

Physics does simulate gravity, collision and springs but it assumes 100% friction and equal mass among points.
